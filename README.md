# WordDayScheduler
A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The app uses moment.js to let the user know the current date, and then based on the time, will let the user know where they are on the schedule. If the events are a light cambridge blue, they've already past. If they're a darker midnight green, then that's the current hour. If they're a light pink lace, then they are in the future. 

A user simply writes their task, and then LOCKS the event in place to save. Locking it will store it in local memory,and then event will persist after the page refreshes.
